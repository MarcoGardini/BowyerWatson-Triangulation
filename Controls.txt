Opening the .exe file will create a console window and a "graphic" window.
To change parameters you need to press the related key on the keyboard, a message will print onto the console.

-COLORS
	The background color has the RGB (red green blue) channels set to 0 after starting the app.
	The main color also has the Alpha channel, aka transparency.
	
	TAB - Calculated Alpha (if true the calculated color value impacts the alpha, or transparency, channel as well)	
	MAIUSC - Every color key will change the related color by 0.1, instead of 0.01, for quicker changes
	
	A - Increase the background's red channel by 0.01 
	Z - Decrease the background's red channel by 0.01 
	S - Increase the background's green channel by 0.01
	X - Decrease the background's green channel by 0.01
	D - Increase the background's blue channel by 0.01
	C - Decrease the background's blue channel by 0.01
	F - Increase the main color's red channel by 0.01 
	V - Decrease the main color's red channel by 0.01 
	G - Increase the main color's green channel by 0.01
	B - Decrease the main color's green channel by 0.01
	H - Increase the main color's blue channel by 0.01
	N - Decrease the main color's blue channel by 0.01
	J - Increase the main color's alpha channel by 0.01
	M - Decrease the main color's alpha channel by 0.01

-COLOR CALCULATION
	You need to use the Keypad

	KPD 0 - Invert color of each triangle, what was bright becomes dark
	KPD 1 - Average distance of each triangle from the center
	KPD 2 - Average vertical position of each triangle
	KPD 3 - Average vertical balance of each triangle
	KPD 4 - Area of each triangle
	KPD 5 - Random (CAREFUL!!! LOTS OF FLASHING)
